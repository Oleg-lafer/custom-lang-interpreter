# custom-lang-interpreter
Created a custom interpreter in Python that supports variable assignment, arithmetic and logical operations, control flow, and AST evaluation. Implemented a lexer for tokenization, a parser for AST generation, and an interpreter for execution. Skills applied include data structures, algorithm design, and compiler theory basics.
